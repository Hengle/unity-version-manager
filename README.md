# unity-version-manager
A commandline application to manage unity versions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Larusso/unity-version-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Larusso/unity-version-manager)

This project is pretty much work in progress. I want to use it as a real life coding exercise in the rust language.
The basic idea is to clone the behavior from [uvm](https://github.com/wooga/unity-version-manager). A commandline tool written in ruby.
